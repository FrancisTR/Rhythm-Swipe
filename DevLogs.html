                Rhythm Swipe has officially entered the Alpha stage of its development!
            </p>
            <p class="OtherParagraph">
                This game was in v1.6.4. However, because there are so many features to be implemented and tested, it makes sense to enter its Alpha stage.
            </p>
            <p class="OtherParagraph">
                To make it less confusing, we are starting the numbering for the Alpha at v1.0.0! As a result, in the game, on the top left of the screen, you will see
                the phrase "Alpha v1.0.0". Happy Swiping!

                We post our updates on the development of the game "Rhythm Swipe"! This game initially
                started as a duo final project for a CS elective course. Francis and John used Processing, which has the same syntax as Java, as well as using Arduino for the game controller.
                It then expanded throughout this summer with more
                people getting involved as Game Testers as well as other roles! Please check back to our DevLogs for more updates on the game!
