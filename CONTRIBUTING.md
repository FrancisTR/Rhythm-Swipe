Before contributing, make sure you follow these steps:

- Anything added must be pushed in a new branch, then merged as a pull request.
- In the pull request, make sure to give a description of the changes you made.
- If your pull request is approved, you will see a comment in that pull request of requesting to change the version in the JS file. Once that change is complete, your pull request will be merged to the main branch.
<!-- Rules about rebase, merge, and squash. See https://help.github.com/articles/about-merging-pull-requests/ -->
